### BIO:

I first heard about IT at the age of 12-13<br>
And then I did not know about any technologies and languages<br>
Then I started learning HTML/CSS in an ad course<br>
I finished the HTML/CSS course at the age of 13,<br>
but then I just taught HTML/CSS without understanding why I was doing it<br>

Then at the age of 14 I learned the basics of Python, and participated in a programming competition using the Python language<br>
And at the age of 15, I enrolled in the free Samsung programming school,<br>
where we were taught Android development in Java,<br>
I graduated from this school in early June<br>

And now I signed up for the 0 stage of JS / Frontend development at RS School, so that later I can sign up for the main RS School course<br>
